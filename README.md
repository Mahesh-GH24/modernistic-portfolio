   ## Installation
   The best way to install front end React application is using Netlify which easily integrates with Github!

   ## Technologies
   React,CSS,Bootstrap,node,npm

   ## Usage
   Please launch the website deployed in netlify using this link - https://netlify-mahesh-react-portfolio.netlify.app/
   You would be landed in the About page giving a introduction about me. There are 3 other tabs - Contact, Portfolio and Resume besides this one. 
   In the future, the Contact section would be integrated with the database when we complete the final version of this App so the contacts are
   stored in the Postgres database and integrated using Models. The Portfolio displays all the different projects that I have built over several 
   months. You should be able to click the picture and launch some of the websites that has UI access. This page comprises of 1 component being
   used several times. The final section is the Resume where I had listed down the skills along with a sample resume!

   ## Challenges
   During the project, I had issues implementing the single component being used in Portfolio. Also, I had little troubles tweaking the page using css and bootstrap.
   

   ## Tests
   Ensure the app opens and ensure you are able to go into each of the tabs - About, Contact, Portfolio and Resume.

   ## Future Implementation
   Fine tune the pages with more advanced bootstrap css, including the usage of Font Awesome icons and animations.
